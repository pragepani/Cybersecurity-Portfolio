# 🧠 AI-Driven Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) with Explainability

**Author:** Prageeth Panicker  
**Focus Areas:** Cybersecurity · AI/ML · Explainable AI · Network Analytics  
**Version:** 2.0 · Last Updated: October 2025  

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **multi-tier Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** that combines **Machine Learning, Autoencoder-based anomaly detection, and rule-based correlation**, integrated with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** explainer powered by **Llama 3.1 : 8B (via Ollama)** for **MITRE ATT&CK** mapping and contextual insights.

The solution processes **Zeek network logs** in real time and produces **interpretable security alerts**—bridging the gap between data-driven detection and human-understandable threat intelligence.

## 🧩 System Architecture

| Layer | Description | Core Components |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Data Layer** | Zeek network traffic parsing, cleaning, and normalization | Zeek logs → Pandas/Parquet → LabelEncoder → Scaler |
| **Detection Layer (3-Tier Ensemble)** | Combines supervised, unsupervised, and rule-based detection | LightGBM · Autoencoder · Rule Engine |
| **Explanation Layer (3-Tier RAG)** | Provides contextual, human-readable insights | **Llama 3.1 : 8B (Ollama)** · Hybrid Templates · MITRE Mapping |
| **Integration Layer** | Real-time ingestion and feedback loop | Zeek → Inference → Output CSV / Alerts |

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Zeek** exports connection, HTTP, and DNS logs.  
2. Data is preprocessed, normalized, and stored in **Parquet format**.  
3. **LightGBM** performs primary supervised classification.  
4. **Autoencoder** validates anomalies using reconstruction error thresholds.  
5. **Rule-based engine** confirms matches with known signatures.  
6. **RAG Explainer** interprets alerts using MITRE ATT&CK and **Llama 3.1 : 8B LLM** (*with smart caching – first occurrence uses LLM, repeated detections use templates*).  
7. Results are exported to **`zeek_3tier_final.csv`** and SOC dashboards.

## 🧠 Model Design (3-Tier Detection Logic)

| Tier | Engine | Role | Decision Basis |
|------|---------|------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | LightGBM | Supervised detection | Trained on labeled CIC-IDS2017 dataset |
| **Tier 2** | Autoencoder | Anomaly detection | Reconstruction error threshold |
| **Tier 3** | Rule Engine | Policy-level validation | Snort/Zeek-style signature rules |

> **Final decision logic:**  
> `(Tier 1 == Attack) OR (Tier 2 > Threshold) OR (Tier 3 == Match) → Intrusion = True`

## 💬 Explainability (Hybrid RAG Explainer)

| Fallback Level | Method | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| **Level 1** | RAG + Llama 3.1 : 8B (Ollama) | Dynamic, context-rich explanations |
| **Level 2** | Hybrid Templates | Fast cached response |
| **Level 3** | MITRE ATT&CK JSON | Deterministic fallback |

**Example Output:**  
> *“Detected behavior aligns with MITRE Technique T1110 – Brute Force, showing multiple failed SSH logins from a single IP within a short interval.”*

## 📈 Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Test Accuracy | **99.89 %** |
| ROC–AUC | **1.0000** |
| Detection Rate (Live Zeek) | **77 – 99 %** |
| LLM Generation Speed | **2 – 3 s per attack (parallel)** |
| Throughput | **2 – 8 flows/s** |
