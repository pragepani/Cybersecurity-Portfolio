> A comprehensive implementation of pfSense firewall configuration with multi-VLAN network segmentation for a cybersecurity home lab environment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project documents the deployment and optimization of a pfSense firewall on MAC-MINI hardware, focusing on establishing baseline security policies for a segmented network environment. The implementation provides a foundation for advanced security monitoring, penetration testing, and network security analysis.

### Key Features

- **Network Segmentation**: Multi-VLAN architecture with dedicated Management, Internal, and User-LAN networks
- **Security Policies**: Documented firewall rules for traffic classification and monitoring
- **Attack Simulation**: Maintained penetration testing capabilities with proper attribution
- **Enhanced Logging**: Strategic logging implementation for traffic pattern analysis
- **Optimized Rules**: Elimination of redundant policies while maintaining operational flexibility

### Network Segments

| Network | CIDR | Purpose | Gateway |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| Management | 192.168.10.0/24 | Administrative access, security tools | 192.168.10.1 |
| Internal | 192.168.30.0/24 | Security platforms (OpenCTI, etc.) | 192.168.30.1 |
| User-LAN | 192.168.40.0/24 | User devices and testing | 192.168.40.1 |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: MAC-MINI with dual network interfaces
- **Software**: pfSense 2.8.0 or later
- **Network**: Managed VLAN-capable switch
- **Access**: Administrative credentials for pfSense web interface

### Installation Steps

1. **Access pfSense Interface**
   ```bash
   https://192.168.10.1
   ```

2. **Review Current Configuration**
   - Navigate to Firewall → Rules
   - Document existing rules and interfaces
   - Verify WAN and LAN interface settings

3. **Implement Security Policies**
   - Create documented rules for administrative traffic
   - Configure logging for traffic analysis
   - Remove redundant firewall rules

4. **Validate Configuration**
   - Test connectivity across network segments
   - Verify logging functionality
   - Confirm attack simulation capabilities

📖 For detailed implementation steps, refer to the [Complete Implementation Guide](IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Firewall Rules (LAN Interface)

| Priority | Rule | Source | Destination | Purpose |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Anti-Lockout | Any | pfSense:443 | System protection |
| 2 | Kali Traffic Documentation | 192.168.10.20 | Any | Log penetration testing |
| 3 | Management Web Services | 192.168.10.0/24 | 192.168.30.0/24:80,443 | Admin access to tools |
| 4 | Default Allow (Logged) | 192.168.10.0/24 | Any | Fallback with visibility |
| 5 | Default Allow IPv6 | LAN IPv6 | Any | IPv6 support |

### Security Features

- ✅ RFC 1918 private network blocking (WAN)
- ✅ Bogon network blocking (WAN)
- ✅ Stateful packet filtering
- ✅ Enhanced traffic logging
- ✅ Anti-lockout protection

## 📊 Project Results

### Performance Metrics

- **Rule Optimization**: 17% reduction in total rules (6→5)
- **Redundancy Elimination**: 100% removal of duplicate functionality
- **Logging Coverage**: 100% visibility on significant traffic patterns
- **Configuration Time**: 2 hours (analysis + implementation + testing)

### Security Improvements

- Enhanced traffic classification for security analysis
- Documented attack simulation activities
- Improved operational visibility
- Maintained lab flexibility with controlled access

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Administrative access to pfSense web interface
- ✅ Cross-network connectivity (Management → Internal)
- ✅ Attack simulation tools (Kali, nmap, web testing)
- ✅ Logging verification and traffic pattern analysis
- ✅ Security tool integration (OpenCTI access)

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Test connectivity to internal services
curl -I http://192.168.30.60:8080

# Verify firewall rule processing
tcpdump -i em1 -n

# Check pfSense logs
tail -f /var/log/filter.log
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Rules not processing as expected
- **Solution**: Verify rule order (top-to-bottom processing)
- Check for more specific rules above general rules
- Review state table for existing connections

**Issue**: Logging not functioning
- **Solution**: Verify log settings under Status → System Logs → Settings
- Enable logging checkbox on specific rules
- Check log retention policies

**Issue**: Connectivity loss after changes
- **Solution**: Anti-lockout rule should prevent total lockout
- Access pfSense console directly if needed
- Restore from configuration backup
