# RAG System Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment
- [x] MITRE knowledge base created (47 techniques)
- [x] Vector database initialized with embeddings
- [x] Production RAG explainer implemented with llama3.1:8b LLM
- [x] Integration with hybrid system complete
- [x] Validation testing passed

## Production Requirements
- [x] Embedding model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- [x] Vector DB: ChromaDB with persistence
- [x] LLM: llama3.1:8b for explanation generation
- [x] Fallback mechanisms: 3-tier (LLM → template → basic)
- [x] Hallucination prevention: Deterministic MITRE ID mapping
- [x] Flow feature integration: Network metrics in explanations

## Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor semantic search latency (<150ms)
- [ ] Track LLM generation success rate
- [ ] Monitor fallback usage (LLM vs template)
- [ ] Track technique mapping accuracy
- [ ] Collect user feedback on explanation quality

## Maintenance
- [ ] Update MITRE knowledge base quarterly
- [ ] Monitor llama3.1:8b model performance
- [ ] Retrain embeddings if KB changes significantly
- [ ] Review and update attack type mappings
- [ ] Performance optimization based on usage patterns
